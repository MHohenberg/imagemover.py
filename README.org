* imagemover.py

This is a tool for people who have large, unsorted collections of files which 
they want to move into keyword-based subdirectories.

** How to use?

1. rename all files you want moved with a preceding keyword of your own choosing (img7238.jpg -> keyword img7238.jpg)
2. execute imagemover: ''imagemover "keyword"''. This will move all files starting with "keyword" into the subdirectory "keyword" and remove "keyword" from the filenames. If a subdirectory does not exist yet, it will be created. (example: keyword img7328.jpg becomes ./keyword/img7328.jpg)

** How to install?

1. make sure you have python installed and in your path. 
2. ''sudo make install''
